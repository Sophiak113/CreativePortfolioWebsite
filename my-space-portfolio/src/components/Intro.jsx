      <p>Sophia Kinsey is a budding software engineer.
I have always had an interest in tech since I was
young, 90% of my childhood photos showcase
me glued to a computer screen (not literally).</p>
<p>
However I didn't begin to seriously pursue this
interest till July 2023 when I began a software engineering bootcamp, it is there I realised all my wacky design ideas (e.g. this website) could be realised with web development!
